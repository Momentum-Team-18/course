## 🎯 Objectives

- Using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) with Django
- Deploying Django applications to [Render](https://www.render.com/)

## 🏗️ Project: Habit Tracker

You'll be working on [Habit Tracker]({{ site.data.projects.habit_tracker.url }}) this week. This project is due on {{ site.data.projects.habit_tracker.due_date | date: "%A, %B %d" }}.

### How to get started

- Read the project requirements **thoroughly** and plan out how you would do this project
- Generate the Django app and project
- Make sure that you are using Postgres, not SQLite
- Design your models. Make sure to create a diagram showing model fields and relationships. _Talk through with each other_ how you are thinking about this.
- You can deploy as soon as you have a Django app that can show the initial rocketship page. Deploying early is a best practice.

**By tomorrow**:

- Your **models** should be functional.
    - "Functional" means you can see and work with them _at least_ in the admin (and ideally in the Django shell) and they do what they are supposed to do and have relationships that work.
- You should be able to create habits and associated daily records in the Django shell (I recommend using [`shell_plus`](https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shell_plus.html) which is available when you have `django-extensions` installed).
- You may have attempted to **deploy** to Render.

- 📺 [Database Design for Beginners](https://youtu.be/1VsSXRPEBo0) _This is a talk from RailsConf, which is focused on Ruby on Rails (Rails is a framework for building web applications in Ruby, very similiar to Django). The talk is an excellent introduction to how to think about your data model -- that is, the logic that drives the decisions you make about the models in your code and the structure of your database. Even though it uses Ruby examples you should be able to get the gist._
