The past few months have prepared you to take on the challenges ahead in these next four weeks. You may not _feel_ ready, but you ARE.

At the end of this phase, your team will present your product to an audience of local tech professionals, hiring partners, and the Momentum community.

## ✅ TODO this morning

1. 🌟 Read this post for an engineer's perspective on an approach to building software that parallels almost precisely the approach we take in Phase 4: [How we use "ship small" to rapidly build new features at GitHub](https://dev.to/mscccc/how-we-use-ship-small-to-rapidly-build-new-features-at-github-5cl9)
2. 💜 [Are you a Chaos Muppet or an Order Muppet? Read this post and **post your personal findings in Slack 👀**.](https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/06/chaos-theory.html)

## ✅ TODO this afternoon with your project team

Project teams will be announced during this afternoon's meeting. Once you have your team assignments, you'll be ready to do the following.

1. **Create a Slack channel** (please [create an actual channel](https://slack.com/help/articles/201402297-Create-a-channel), not a thread) and add your team members and Momentum staff (Jessica, Raschelle, Rebecca, and Amy) to it.
2. **Create a team charter** together and pin or bookmark the document you create in your team's Slack channel. This is an agreement you create together to determine the expectations you have for each other and ensure you can met your goals. Use your experience working on teams in the past to figure out what will help you work together with a minimum of friction and a maximum of productivity. [Here are references][team-charter] to help you with creating this agreement.
3. Brainstorm ideas for your final project with your team, and **be ready to pitch one or two ideas tomorrow morning**.
