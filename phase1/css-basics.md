## 🎯 Objectives

- Styling a page with CSS
- CSS syntax: selectors, properties, values; shorthand properties
- Working with color, text and font properties, and backgrounds
- The box model, margin, and padding
- Units of measurement

## 🏗️ Project

Begin styling your dog adoption website. 🐕 💅

You won't be able to do all of it at once. Your HTML should be in place first. You can then begin adding classes for the elements that you want to style.

Think about how to group your elements together so you can apply styles effectively to groups of things that look the same.
